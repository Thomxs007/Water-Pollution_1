        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of water bodies. Water pollution is caused when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater and aquifers get contaminated with industrial and agricultural effluents.When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.</p>

        <h2>Types Of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p><div>
           1.Chemical Pollution:
        </div><br>
            The most common type of water pollution, chemicals can infiltrate both underground water sources and those sitting on the Earth’s surface. As an integral component of the agricultural industry, it’s unsurprising that much of chemical contamination comes from the pesticides and fungicides used in farming, but metals and solvents from industrial sites are also leading contributors.<br>
            <br>
            <div>
                2.Groundwater Pollution:
            </div><br>
            As mentioned above, agriculture is a key source of water pollution, especially for groundwater. Fertilisers and pesticides applied to crops can seep into the ground and contaminate underwater rivers and waterbeds, thus compromising the quality of wells, boreholes and other places from which groundwater is extracted for human use.<br>
            
            <br>
            <div>
                3.Microbiological Pollution:
            </div><br>
            Unlike most others on this list, microbiological pollution is a naturally occurring form of water contamination. Microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa and viruses can infiltrate water supplies, causing diseases such as bilharzia and cholera. Humans are most susceptible to this kind of pollution in places where adequate water treatment systems are not yet in place.<br>
            <br>
            <div>
                4.Nutrient Pollution:
            </div><br>
            While they’re vital for underwater flora and fauna to flourish, an excess of nutrients can upset the delicate imbalance of water-based ecosystems. Fertilisers contain a high concentration of nutrients which, if they contaminate rivers, lakes and coastal areas, can cause algal blooming that can block out sunlight and inhibit the growth of other organisms.<br>
            <br>
            <div>
                5.Oxygen-Depletion Pollution:
            </div><br>
            Another consequence of algal blooms is their consumption of oxygen supplies. This means that those species which depend upon oxygen to survive are killed off, while anaerobic ones thrive. Some anaerobic microorganisms are capable of producing ammonia, sulphides and other harmful toxins, which can make the water even more dangerous to animals (and humans, too).<br>
            <br>
            <div>
                6.Surface Water Pollution:
            </div><br>  
            Referring to all water sources above ground, such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, surface water pollution can occur both naturally, accidentally and intentionally. For example, monitoring has an all-important role in natural flood management, which can lead to poor water quality, while accidental oil spills and negligent industries emptying waste into water bodies are also key contributors.<br></p>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
        <div>
            <img id="causepic" src="water pollution 2.avif">
        </div>
        <p>Water is one of the most important elements on Earth when it comes to sustaining life. Unfortunately, it is also extremely susceptible to pollution. This is largely because water is a universal solvent that can dissolve many substances. While this is a wonderful quality that we take advantage of for everyday tasks such as cooking, cleaning and taking medication, it is also the exact quality that causes water to become polluted so easily. 
            There are many causes of water pollution. Below, we will focus on seven of the major ways that water can become polluted.<br>
            
            <div>
                1. Industrial Waste:
            </div><br>
            Industries and industrial sites across the world are a major contributor to water pollution. Many industrial sites produce waste in the form of toxic chemicals and pollutants, and though regulated, some still do not have proper waste management systems in place. In those rare cases, industrial waste is dumped into nearby freshwater systems. When industrial waste is not treated properly (or worse, not treated at all), it can very easily pollute the freshwater systems that it comes into contact with. 
            Industrial waste from agricultural sites, mines and manufacturing plants can make its way into rivers, streams and other bodies of water that lead directly to the sea. The toxic chemicals in the waste produced by these industries not only have the potential to make water unsafe for human consumption, they can also cause the temperature in freshwater systems to change, making them dangerous for many water dwelling organisms.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                2. Marine Dumping:
            </div><br>
            The process of marine dumping is exactly what it sounds like, dumping garbage into the waters of the ocean. It might seem crazy, but household garbage is still collected and dumped into oceans by many countries across the world. Most of these items can take anywhere from two to 200 years to decompose completely.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                3. Sewage and Wastewater:
            </div><br>
            Harmful chemicals, bacteria and pathogens can be found in sewage and wastewater even when it’s been treated. Sewage and wastewater from each household is released into the sea with fresh water. The pathogens and bacteria found in that wastewater breed disease, and therefore are a cause of health-related issues in humans and animals alike.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                4. Oil Leaks and Spills:
            </div><br>
            The age-old phrase “like water and oil” is used when describing two things that do not mix easily or at all. Just as the saying states, water and oil do not mix, and oil does not dissolve in water. Large oil spills and oil leaks, while often accidental, are a major cause of water pollution. Leaks and spills often are caused by oil drilling operations in the ocean or ships that transport oil.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                5. Agriculture:
            </div><br>
            In order to protect their crops from bacteria and insects, farmers often use chemicals and pesticides. When these substances seep into the groundwater, they can harm animals, plants and humans. Additionally, when it rains, the chemicals mix with rainwater, which then flows into rivers and streams that filter into the ocean, causing further water pollution.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                6. Global Warming:
            </div><br>
            Rising temperatures due to global warming are a major concern in terms of water pollution. Global warming causes water temperatures to rise, which can kill water-dwelling animals. When large die-offs occur, it further pollutes the water supply, exacerbating the issue. 
            There are many everyday ways you can help reduce global warming, which will in turn help lower water pollution. These methods include recycling, carpooling and using CFL bulbs in your home.<br>
            
            <br><div>
                7. Radioactive Waste:
            </div></b>
            Radioactive waste from facilities that create nuclear energy can be extremely hazardous to the environment and must be disposed of properly. This is because uranium, the element used in the creation of nuclear energy, is a highly toxic chemical. 
            Unfortunately, accidents still occur at these facilities, and toxic waste is released into the environment. The coal and gas industries are, in many ways, no better. This is one of the major impetuses behind the development of alternative, clean sources of energy, including solar and wind.</p>

        <h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p><b>Diseases:</b> In humans, drinking or consuming polluted water in any way has many disastrous effects on our health.<br>It causes typhoid, cholera, hepatitis and various other diseases.<br>
            <br><b>Destruction of Ecosystems:</b> Ecosystems are extremely dynamic and respond to even small changes in the environment.<br> Water pollution can cause an entire ecosystem to collapse if left unchecked.<br>
            <br><b>Eutrophication:</b> Chemicals in a water body, encourage the growth of algae. These algae form a layer on top of the pond or lake.<br> Bacteria feed on this algae and this decreases the amount of oxygen in the water body, severely affecting the aquatic life there.<br>
            <br><b>Effects the food chain:</b> Disruption in food chains happens when toxins and pollutants in the water are consumed by aquatic animals (fish, shellfish etc) which are then consumed by humans.<br></p>
